Introduction</h1> <p>  Drive-by-Wire-Systems are now state-of-the-art technology for control gasoline and diesel engines. The high conditions on these systems and the integration into networked vehicle systems requires a closely monitoring of their functionalities.<br> A group of German automotive manufacturers(<a href="https://www.vda.de/en">VDA</a>) have created the EGAS working group, with target of standardize the monitoring concept for their engine control system. Below image show the main points about EGAS Concept. <img src="./EGAS Architecture Concept_files/EGAS-overview.png" alt="EGAS Overview"></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>safety-architecture</strong>*: EGAS architecture concept is in compliance with the ISO26262 specification. Because of this, you can apply the concept for your functional safety project(other systems in vehicle that required closely monitoring) as a well-trusted design principles.</p> </blockquote> <h1 id="ii-basic-principles">II. Basic principles</h1> <blockquote> <p><strong>Terminology:</strong><br> <strong>driving cycle</strong>: operation time between the key initiate engine start/stop.<br> <strong>fault detection</strong>: identification of exceeding permissible deviations of the relevant system parameters leading to a non-fulfillment of at least one requirement regarding a required characteristic.<br> <strong>failure effect</strong>: deviation of the system behavior in a faulty condition to the system behavior in a fault-free condition.<br> <strong>failure reaction</strong>: the completeness of all initiated measures after the error detection, in order to reduce the failure effect to a permissible limit.<br> <strong>E/E</strong>: electrical and electronic.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="ii1-guidelines-for-development">II.1 Guidelines for development</h3> <p>  Below are list of <strong>EGAS Developing Guidelines</strong> that shall be adhere during development of a system following EGAS concept. Under each guideline item is an further explanation base on my own understanding and experiences.</p> <ol> <li>Protection of life has the highest priority.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ pretty straight forward, safety of the driver and anyone involve is the most importance.</span></li> <li>Reliability has higher priority than backup functions.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ strive for a <strong>stable and durable</strong> system</span></li> <li>The monitoring shall be independent of the engine concept and as far as possible independent of the driver reaction.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ monitoring unit shall not influent anything to system and user.</span></li> <li>Functions, in particular for system monitoring (also error reactions), shall be easy and manageable.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ keep it <strong>simple</strong>.</span></li> <li>The system shall be designed so that single errors and single errors in combination with latent errors lead to controllable system reactions. The corresponding signal paths (sensors, actuators, functions) shall be monitored.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ single point fault shall be covered by safety mechanism(1st) and latent fault shall be covered by another level of safety mechanism (2nd mechanism to detect the failure of safety mechanism(1st), which cover the single point fault).</span><br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ <strong>signal paths</strong>(from sensors to the logic processing unit, internal values of control function and control signal to actuators) shall be monitored.</span></li> <li>The system shall be designed so that double and dual faults lead to controllable system reaction as required as state-of-the-art.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ required safety mechanism to cover dual-point fault(similar with item 5), not clear the term as state-of-the-art mean (possibly using the newest technology? but it is against ISO26262 recommendation of using well trusted design principles - i.e use of previous used design/system with known failures(so we can predict and prevent) is better than new design/system with new or unknown failures).</span></li> <li>In terms of high system availability, staged error reactions shall strive.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ <strong>staged error reactions(different level of error reaction)</strong>, i.e. system can not just stop operate or reset with a minor error, different level of error reaction such as: reset software component, reset tasks, reset MCU’s core, hardware reset MCU, reset whole system(ECU),…</span></li> <li>A signal path shall be classified as “confirmed defected” after an explicit detection (e.g. after debouncing event or time) and before the reaction shall be activated. Previously the defect shall be classified as “assumed defect”<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ debouncing concept same as diagnostic event debouncing (DEM_EVENT_STATUS_PREFAILED, DEM_EVENT_STATUS_FAILED) in AUTOSAR Diagnostic Event Manager</span></li> <li>Appropriate reaction mechanisms shall be defined according to the function in the case of an “assumed defect” and “confirmed defect”.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ each fault/defect shall be mapped with a corresponding safe/degradation operation</span></li> <li>The reset of fault reactions shall be determined in individual cases and shall be performed controllable. Non-continuous transitions shall be avoided.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ each fault/defect reaction shall has corresponding healing operation, transition from safe/degradation state to normal operation shall be continuous.</span></li> <li>Engine stop is permitted when no other controllable system reaction can be ensured.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ complete shutdown of system actuator is permitted when no controllable safe state can be achieved i.e. priority in term of measures: always try to have the system operational, then degraded/limited function and the last resort is shutdown of system</span></li> <li>The <strong>transmitter is responsible for the content of its initiated messages</strong> at the control unit interface. This means that e.g. external torque requests by the transmitting control unit shall be secured. The transmission path and the actuality of the messages shall be checked by the engine control system.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ the sender of message shall <strong>ensure the correctness of the transmitted data</strong>. The quality of transmitted data can be checked(to detect any kind of corruption on data either by software or physical transmission path) by applying <strong>E2E protection on sender side</strong> and <strong>E2E check on receiver side</strong>.</span></li> <li>If errors happen in combination with the subsequent single errors cause unintended system reactions, the driver should be informed. (optically or by modifying the driving behavior).<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ detected multiple point faults should be informed to driver via HMI cluster(warning telltale, audio cue) or put vehicle into degraded mode.</span></li> <li>The monitoring of the function controller must be kept robust and simple. This includes a possible implementation with an ASIC.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ monitoring of function controller(i.e. logic control unit for intended function) shall be done by external hardware supervisor(i.e. System Basis Chip-SBC or Power Management IC-PMIC, usually semiconductor shall provide these kind of solution along with their MCU/SoC for strict safety system.)</span></li> <li>The effectiveness of the redundant shutoff paths shall be tested in each driving cycle.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ test the shutoff path of the actuator (both main function and diagnostic function) working properly should be done for every power on phase i.e. startup diagnostic operation</span></li> <li>Shutoff paths of the monitoring concept shall be robust if a defect power supply drifts. The power supply concept shall be monitored to avoid possible damage to components. Controllable failure reactions shall be initiated.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ power supply of system component shall be monitored, same as item 14, usually SBC/PMIC shall provide external hardware supervisor functionalities such as: voltage rail monitor, external watchdog, function controller’s errors monitor</span></li> <li>The technical safety concept shall be implemented in accordance with the requirements of ISO26262.<br> <span style="color:#3ac580">⟹ EGAS concept is in compliance with ISO26262</span></li> </ol> <h3 id="ii2-the-architecture">II.2 The Architecture</h3> <p>  Now we will go into system architecture design to cover above principles.With a basic system, we should have inputs(sensor data, communication data,…), processing unit(which carry out control operation and intended functions), outputs(actuators being controlled by the processing unit, causing effect on the outside environment).<br>   If the basic system only care about functioning as its intended, corresponding to the inputs, and able to keep operating consistently over a long period of time then we can say the system is reliable. But upon faulty inputs(user use it wrong, corruption of input data, abnormal operating condition…) or fault that’s rooted from the internal components(part ware down, random faulty E/E part,…), how does the system react? Could it cause a catastrophic failure and effect to the surrounding environment and users ⟹ If so we can say that is not a safe system, reliable might be but not safe.<br> On the other hand, Safe system beside carry out its intended function, it shall address the reaction of it when failure occur in the system. Safe system shall react properly, make potential dangerous failure become <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">safe failure</code></strong> (i.e. system change to a state that prevent damages that could create hazards toward user).</p> <p>  As said above, when system involve human interaction, we should not design a basic system and only consider its reliability. We should design a system to be safe.<br> Below table is list of system configuration for example base system(1 out of 1 i.e. 1 logical processing unit, 1 actuator switches(enable/disable output))</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Architecture</th> <th style="text-align: center">No of Logical Processing Unit</th> <th style="text-align: center">No of Actuator Switches</th> <th style="text-align: center">Characteristic</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1oo1</td> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> <td style="text-align: center">Base system</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1oo2</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">High Safety</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1oo1D</td> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">High Safety</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">2oo2</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">Availability</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1oo2D</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">4</td> <td style="text-align: center">Safety and Availability</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">2oo3</td> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> <td style="text-align: center">6</td> <td style="text-align: center">Safety and Availability</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote> <p>*D: diagnostic</p> </blockquote> <p><img src="./EGAS Architecture Concept_files/EGAS-configuration_1.png" alt="alt"> <img src="./EGAS Architecture Concept_files/EGAS-configuration_2.png" alt="alt"> <img src="./EGAS Architecture Concept_files/EGAS-configuration_3.png" alt="alt"></p> <p>With different configuration of architecture, we can achieve different target in term of availability(keep system available when fault occur) and safety.<br> We can see that 1oo1D and 1oo2(serial on the output) offer the same “High Safety” characteristic, however 1oo1D configuration provide safety by increasing system diagnostic coverage and does not require a duplication of main processing component as 1oo2.

Conclusion</h1> <p>Generally, the EGAS concept adheres to the 1oo1D system configuration, which involves monitoring the primary function and diagnosing the safety signal path. Any identified faults are addressed appropriately through a staged error reaction, causing the system to transition into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fail-silent, fail-degraded, or fail-stop</code> state..<br> ⟹ a good design concept to be adopted for ASIL B (and lower safety integrity system).</p> <p>As the automotive world evolves with intricate features like ADAS and autonomous driving, the demand for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fail-operational</code> systems is also on the rise. Therefore, it would be beneficial to explore safety architecture designs from other fields, such as avionics, to comprehend, adapt, and customize existing technical solutions and design principles and apply it to our automotive system.</p> <br> <div class="tag-list"> <a href="https://nvdungx.github.io/tags/#intermediate">#intermediate</a> &nbsp; <a href="https://nvdungx.github.io/tags/#functional%20safety">#functional safety</a> &nbsp; <a href="https://nvdungx.github.io/tags/#design">#design</a> </div> </article> <div class="PageNavigation"> <a class="prev" href="https://nvdungx.github.io/unified-diagnostic-protocol-overview/">← Previous</a> <a class="next" href="https://nvdungx.github.io/install-wsl-and-using-it-with-proxy/">Next →</a> </div> <aside class="related"> <h3>Related Posts</h3> <ul class="related-posts"> <li> <a href="https://nvdungx.github.io/Adaptive-AUTOSAR/"> Adaptive AUTOSAR Overview <small><time datetime="2024-02-26T10:21:40+07:00">February 26th, 2024</time></small> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://nvdungx.github.io/FUSA-FTTI/"> ISO26262 - Fault Tolerance Time Interval(FTTI) <small><time datetime="2023-10-04T18:29:47+07:00">October 4th, 2023</time></small> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://nvdungx.github.io/CHAdeMO-specification-and-software-design/"> CHAdeMO standard and design <small><time datetime="2023-04-16T08:40:25+07:00">April 16th, 2023</time></small> </a> </li> </ul> </aside> </main> <footer class="footer"> <p><a href="https://nvdungx.github.io/">Junnv</a> site host with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> <br><a href="https://nvdungx.github.io/LICENSE.md">Released under MIT License</a></p> </footer> </div>
